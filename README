This is the first Linux-ia32 (as opposed to FreeBSD-ia32) 4k we've made in 15
years. Change in platform courtesy of PoroCYon, who figured out the Linux
stack alignment bug.

Name comes from the last shore on Earth, in Región de Magallanes y de la
Antártica Chilena. Faro San Isidro, the last building on earth was supposed to
be in the intro, but there was no entropy left for it.
